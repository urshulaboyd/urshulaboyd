- 👋 Hi, I’m @urshulaboyd!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software development. There are so many things I want to build, I don't know where to start! I have been for a long time but didn't think I could do it. There is nothing else I'd rather do!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics...HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git/GitHub. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects as my skill level allows.
- 📫 How to reach me: uboyd1982@gmail.com
